## Position Properties
    - Static: This is a bydefault position of an element. Top,Bottom,left and right properties don't work on it. The element remains in the document normal flow.

    - Relative: The element set to relative to itself. Top, bottom, left and right properties work on it. The element reamins in normal flow of document.

    - Absolute: The element set to relative to its nearest positioned ansestor. It means, nearst ansestor has to have any position besides static. The top, bottom, left and right properties works on element. The document removed from normal flow.

    - Fixed: The document removes from normal flow and it is set relative to its root element.The position of element is fixed at where we se it using top, bottom, left and right properties.

    - Sticky: This is the combined property of fixed and relative. It remains normal flow of the document but when it comes to the position which we set using top, bottom, right or left properties it fixed and removes from normal flow of document.

## Display Properties
    - There are two groups of display properties, inner display properties determines how the child items will behave, flex, grid and float are the inner display properties whereas, the out display properties determines how the element itself will behave on document's normal flow, block, inline, inline-block are the outer display properties.
